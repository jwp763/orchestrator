# =============================================================================
# SUMMARY AND DEPENDENCIES
# =============================================================================

# Phase 1 (Critical): DEL-003 → DEL-004 → DEL-005 → DEL-006 → DEL-007 → DEL-008
# Phase 2 (High): DEL-009 → DEL-010 → DEL-011 (depends on Phase 1)
# Phase 3 (Medium/Low): DEL-012 → DEL-013 → DEL-014 → DEL-015 (depends on Phase 1 & 2)

# Total estimated effort: 3,570 minutes (59.5 hours, ~15 working days)
# Critical path: Phase 1 must be completed first, then Phase 2 and 3 can overlap

# Expected outcomes:
# - 90% reduction in deployment failures
# - One-command setup for each environment
# - Reliable dogfooding workflow with data protection
# - Production-ready deployment pipeline
# - Comprehensive documentation that matches implementation
