    Fix N+1 query pattern in project service that causes performance degradation.
    Currently executing separate queries for tasks on each project load.
    
    Location: backend/src/orchestration/project_service.py:96-98
    Issue: Separate query for tasks on each project load
    Impact: Performance scales linearly with project count (O(n) queries)
    
    Current problematic code:
    # Get associated tasks for the project
    tasks = self.storage.get_tasks_by_project(project_id)
    project.tasks = tasks
    
    Requirements:
    - Implement SQL joins or eager loading
    - Use SQLAlchemy relationship loading strategies
    - Add query optimization for bulk project loading
    - Maintain backwards compatibility with existing API

    Fix inefficient pagination that loads all records to count them.
    Currently loading up to 1000 projects just to get total count.
    
    Location: backend/src/api/project_routes.py:139-141
    Issue: Loading all projects to count them for pagination
