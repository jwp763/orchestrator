```

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `backend-guide.md`
- Be descriptive but concise: `api-endpoints.md` not `api.md`
- Use `.md` extension for all documentation
- Number ADRs: `001-use-fastapi.md`

## Document Structure

### Required Elements

Every documentation file MUST include:

1. **Title** (H1) - Clear, descriptive title
2. **Purpose Statement** - One paragraph explaining what the document covers
3. **Table of Contents** - For files > 300 lines
4. **Sections** - Logical organization with headers
5. **Related Links** - Links to related documentation

### Header Hierarchy

```markdown
# Document Title (H1 - One per document)

Brief description of what this document covers.

## Table of Contents (H2 - If needed)

## Major Section (H2)

### Subsection (H3)

#### Detail Level (H4)

##### Fine Detail (H5 - Avoid if possible)
```

## Writing Style

### General Guidelines

- **Be Concise**: Get to the point quickly
- **Use Active Voice**: "The system processes..." not "Processing is done by..."
- **Present Tense**: "The API returns..." not "The API will return..."
- **Second Person**: Address the reader as "you"
- **Examples**: Include code examples for technical concepts

### Code Examples

```markdown
Always include language identifier:
â€‹```python
def example():
    return "Hello"
â€‹```

Include context and explanation:
# Good: Explains what and why
â€‹```python
# Configure retry logic for resilient API calls
retry_config = {
    "max_attempts": 3,
    "backoff_factor": 2
}
â€‹```
```

### Lists and Tables

Use tables for structured data:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Auth | âœ… | JWT-based |
| RBAC | ðŸš§ | In progress |

Use lists for sequential steps or unordered items:

1. Install dependencies
2. Configure environment
3. Run the application

## File Size Guidelines

### Size Limits

- **Ideal**: < 10KB (approx. 300 lines)
- **Acceptable**: < 20KB (approx. 600 lines)
- **Requires Split**: > 20KB

### When to Split Documents

Split large documents when:
- File exceeds 600 lines
- Multiple distinct topics are covered
- Different audiences (dev vs. ops)

### How to Split

1. Identify logical sections
2. Create new files for each major topic
3. Update original file with links
4. Add navigation between related docs

## Required Sections
