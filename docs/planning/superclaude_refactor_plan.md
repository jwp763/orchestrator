# SuperClaude Refactor Plan: Two-Phase Documentation Alignment

## Overview

The planning documentation is severely out of sync with the actual repository state. The system is 85-90% complete, not 30-40% as docs suggest. This plan uses SuperClaude to:

**Phase A**: Update planning docs to reflect actual current state (reality check)
**Phase B**: Align updated docs with new sprint plan (future direction)

## Current State Reality Check

### What Planning Docs Claim vs Reality

- **API Layer**: Docs say "Not Started" → Reality: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Agent System**: Docs say "85% Complete (PlannerAgent)" → Reality: ✅ 95% COMPLETE (multiple agents)
- **Storage Layer**: Docs say "90% Complete" → Reality: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Frontend**: Docs say "In Progress" → Reality: ✅ 85% COMPLETE
- **Orchestration Services**: Docs don't mention → Reality: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### Actual Implementation Status

- Complete FastAPI backend with CRUD operations
- Multiple AI agents (Planner, Orchestrator, Base)
- Full storage layer with SQL implementation
- React frontend with comprehensive components
- Service layer with business logic
- Comprehensive test coverage (672+ tests)

## PHASE A: Reality Alignment - Update Docs to Match Current State

### Step A1: Current State Documentation Audit

**Command**: `/analyze --architecture --persona-architect --introspect --evidence`

**Context Prompt**:

```
I need to conduct a comprehensive audit of the current implementation state vs planning documentation claims.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS:
Please analyze these actual implemented components and provide accurate completion percentages:

BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:
- backend/src/api/ (main.py, project_routes.py, task_routes.py, planner_routes.py, models.py, middleware.py)
- backend/src/agent/ (base.py, planner_agent.py, orchestrator_agent.py, tools.py, prompts.py)
- backend/src/storage/ (sql_implementation.py, sql_models.py, interface.py, repositories/, session_manager.py)
- backend/src/orchestration/ (project_service.py, task_service.py, agent_service.py)
- backend/src/models/ (project.py, task.py, patch.py, agent.py, user.py, integration.py)

FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION:
- frontend/src/components/ (ProjectSidebar, TaskCard, TaskDetails, ProjectDetails, NaturalLanguageEditor, ApiTest)
- frontend/src/services/ (api.ts, projectService.ts, taskService.ts)
- frontend/src/hooks/ (useLocalStorage, usePlannerAPI, useProjectManagement)
- frontend/src/types/ (api.ts, index.ts)
- frontend/src/utils/ (colors, date)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Assess actual functionality vs planning document claims
2. Identify what's fully implemented vs partially implemented
3. Document missing components or gaps
4. Provide accurate completion percentages
5. Compare with current planning document claims

4. Add "Additional Features" sections for work beyond original scope
5. Update time estimates with actual completion times
6. Document architectural decisions and implementation choices
7. Add testing and quality assurance sections

Focus on celebrating achieved work and providing accurate status.
```

## PHASE B: Future Direction - Align with New Sprint Plan

### Step B1: Gap Analysis for New Sprint Plan

**Command**: `/analyze --gaps --persona-architect --compare --evidence`

**Context Prompt**:

```
Compare the current actual implementation state with the new sprint plan requirements.


GAP ANALYSIS NEEDED:
1. What current features can be reused for new chat interface?
2. What new components need to be built?
3. How do current agents fit into new agent topology?
4. What database changes are needed for conversation storage?
5. What frontend components need modification vs new development?
6. What APIs need to be added vs modified?

Provide specific recommendations for bridging current state to @next_sprint_plan.
```

### Step B2: Architecture Bridge Planning

**Command**: `/design --bridge --persona-architect --migration --evidence`

**Context Prompt**:

```
Design a bridge from current implementation to new sprint plan architecture.


BRIDGE DESIGN NEEDED:
1. How to extend current storage for conversation data?
