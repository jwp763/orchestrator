## Key Milestones üéØ

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| W27 | Foundation complete, ready for planner development |
| W28-29 | First natural language plan successfully created |
| W30 | MVP plan synced to Motion, team using it |
| W31 | Interactive planning UI available |
| W32 | System handles 10k tasks with <2s response |
| W33 | Public v1.0 release |

## Success Metrics üìä

- **Adoption**: 10+ projects planned in first week
- **Accuracy**: <20% time estimate error
- **Performance**: <2s planning time for typical projects
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for sync operations

## Notes üìù

- This TODO list represents the MVP plan itself - we're dogfooding!
- Each task has detailed specifications in `docs/mvp_plan.md`
- All tasks should be created in the system once Phase 1 is complete
- Regular sync meetings scheduled to review progress
