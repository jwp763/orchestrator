# Short Term Plan (Next 2-4 Weeks)

## Phase 1: Core Orchestration Engine (Week 1)

### Task 5: Build Orchestration Engine with Task Routing
**Priority**: High  
**Files**: `src/orchestration/`  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

#### Step 5.1: Create Orchestrator Core (Day 1)
```python
# Create src/orchestration/orchestrator.py
class AgentOrchestrator:
    - Initialize with agent, delta_manager, integrations
    - process_user_request() - main entry point
    - execute_action() - handle agent actions
    - route_to_integration() - direct actions to correct service
```

**Implementation Details**:
- Parse agent responses and extract actions
- Route create_project/create_task to appropriate integrations
- Handle multi-step workflows (e.g., create project in Motion, then tasks)
- Implement retry logic for failed operations
- Log all orchestration decisions and outcomes

#### Step 5.2: Implement Task Processor (Day 2)
```python
# Create src/orchestration/task_processor.py
class TaskProcessor:
    - execute_create_project() - handle project creation workflow
    - execute_create_task() - handle task creation with dependencies
    - execute_sync_operation() - manage sync between systems
    - handle_batch_operations() - process multiple related actions
```

**Key Features**:
- Validate actions before execution
- Handle integration-specific data transformation
- Manage transaction-like behavior (rollback on failures)
- Support for conditional actions based on context

#### Step 5.3: Add Smart Routing Logic (Day 3)
```python
# Add to orchestration system
class IntegrationRouter:
    - determine_primary_integration() - choose best integration for action
    - handle_cross_integration_sync() - sync data between integrations
    - resolve_conflicts() - handle data conflicts during sync
```

**Routing Rules**:
- Tasks with deadlines → Motion (for scheduling)
- Engineering tasks → Linear (for ticket tracking)
- Documentation tasks → Notion
- Code-related tasks → GitLab issues

#### Step 5.4: Integration with Agent Tools (Day 4)
- Update agent tools to call orchestrator instead of direct API calls

- Daily task creation workflow
- Integration sync status check
- Progress reporting and analytics
```

#### Step 6.3: Create Sync Management Notebook
```python
# Create notebooks/03_sync_management.py

- Data conflict resolution interface
- Integration health checks
```

## Phase 2: Integration Expansion (Week 2-3)

### Task 7: Linear Integration
**Priority**: Medium  
**Files**: `src/integrations/linear.py`  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

#### Step 7.1: Linear API Client (Day 1)
```python
# Create src/integrations/linear.py
class LinearIntegration(BaseIntegration):
    - Implement GraphQL API client
    - Handle Linear's issue and project model
    - Map Linear teams to our project structure
    - Handle Linear's state/status mapping
```

**Linear-Specific Features**:
- Issue creation with proper team assignment
- Label and priority mapping
- Milestone and project association
- Comment synchronization

#### Step 7.2: Data Mapping and Sync (Day 2)
- Map Linear issues to our task model
- Handle Linear's unique identifiers and relationships
- Implement bidirectional sync logic
- Handle Linear webhooks (basic structure)

#### Step 7.3: Testing and Integration (Day 3)
- Test Linear integration in isolation
- Test integration with orchestration engine
- Add Linear examples to notebooks
- Document Linear-specific configuration

### Task 8: Basic GitLab Integration
**Priority**: Low  
**Files**: `src/integrations/gitlab.py`  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days

#### Step 8.1: GitLab API Client (Day 1)
```python
# Create src/integrations/gitlab.py
class GitLabIntegration(BaseIntegration):
    - Implement GitLab REST API client
    - Handle GitLab projects and issues
    - Map GitLab milestones to our projects
    - Handle merge request tracking
```

#### Step 8.2: Code-Focused Workflows (Day 2)
- Link tasks to GitLab issues
- Track merge requests and commits
- Handle GitLab's issue board integration
- Implement basic milestone tracking

## Phase 3: Testing and Reliability (Week 3-4)

### Task 9: Comprehensive Testing Suite
**Priority**: High  
**Files**: `tests/`  
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 days

#### Step 9.1: Unit Tests (Day 1-2)
```python
# Create tests/ directory structure
tests/
├── test_models.py          # Test Pydantic models
├── test_delta_manager.py   # Test database operations
├── test_agent.py          # Test agent functionality
├── test_integrations/     # Test each integration
└── test_orchestration.py  # Test orchestration logic
```

#### Step 9.2: Integration Tests (Day 3)
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Test error handling and recovery
- Test data consistency across integrations

#### Step 10.2: Example Workflows
- Create example workflows for common use cases
- Add sample data and scenarios
- Create video walkthroughs (scripts)
- Document best practices

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- All new code must include comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints required for all function signatures
- Error handling must be explicit and informative
- Logging must be structured and consistent

### Testing Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new components
- All external API calls must be mockable
- Integration tests must be repeatable and isolated
- Performance tests must have baseline metrics

### Documentation Standards
- All new features must include usage examples
- Configuration changes must be documented
- Breaking changes must include migration guides
- Public APIs must have comprehensive documentation

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success Metrics
- ✅ Orchestration engine handles basic project/task creation
- ✅ Agent can successfully route actions to appropriate integrations
- ✅ Enhanced notebooks demonstrate key workflows
- ✅ Error handling provides clear feedback to users

### Week 2 Success Metrics
- ✅ Linear integration creates and syncs issues successfully
- ✅ Multi-integration workflows work end-to-end
- ✅ Sync conflicts are handled gracefully

- ✅ System is ready for daily production use

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting and backoff strategies
- **Data Conflicts**: Design clear conflict resolution strategies
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize database query patterns

### Integration Risks
- **API Changes**: Version pin external dependencies and monitor for breaking changes
- **Authentication**: Implement secure credential management
- **Service Downtime**: Design graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strictly prioritize must-have vs nice-to-have features
- **Dependencies**: Identify external blockers early and have contingency plans
- **Testing Delays**: Allocate sufficient time for proper testing and debugging
